        <h1>How Do We Interact With Computers?</h1>
        <p>Over time, computers have become easier to use However, things can still go wrong. When problems happen, there are things you can do.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Human-Computer Interaction</h2>
        <p>The <mark>user interface</mark> (UI) incudes all the parts of a computing system that you use to operate the computer. For example, the user interface for playing a video game on a phone includes the touch screen, speakers/headphones, and the game's on-screen menus, buttons, and graphics.</p>
        <br>
        <p>A <mark>graphical user interface</mark> (GUI, pronounced "GOO-ey," like soft brownies) is a type of user interface that uses icons and symbols on a screen instead of just plain text. A GUI makes it easy for just about anyone to use a computer. Most user interfaces are GUIs.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The <mark>command-line interface</mark> (command line, or CLI) uses only text to operate a computer. This type of interface is more difficult to se because the user must type specific commands, or phrases, for it to work. Although most computer users will never need to use a command-line interface, it's a good thing to learn if you're a computer scientist.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Human-computer interaction (HCI) is the part of computer science that studies and improves how the user works with computers. UIs are easy for all people to use, including those who are blind or low vision or are deaf or hard of hearing.</p>
        <br>
        <p>You can try out an example of human-computer interaction by finding the "Accessibility" settings on your computer or phone and turning on the screen reader to listen to it read aloud what's on the display.</p>
        <br>
        <p>For examp;, many phones have a built-in screen readers (a program that reads aloud the words on the screen). This allows users who are blind or have a hard time seeing to still use their phone.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
        <p><mark>Troubleshooting</mark> is taking a systematic, or styp-by-step, approach to solving errors within a computing system or software. Or, debugging programs in a software.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Using a <mark>systematic approach</mark> means following a fixed plan or process, step-by-step. Like instructions for making a PB&J sandwitch. If your computer won't turn on, one of the first things you would do is make sure it is plugged into a power source, and then you would check that all the power connnectors inside the computer are connected securely. The benifit to a systematic approach is that you can repeat the steps exactly and you can be sure you haven't left anything out.</p>
        <br>
        <p><mark>Debugging</mark> is finding and correcting "bugs", or errors, within a program. Debugging is a specific form of troubleshooting that is used when programming. Bugs may be caused by typos or by not following the rules or format of the programming language.</p>
