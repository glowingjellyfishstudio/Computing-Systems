        <h1>How Do We Interact With Computers?</h1>
        <p>Over time, computers have become easier to use However, things can still go wrong. When problems happen, there are things you can do.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Human-Computer Interaction</h2>
        <p>The <mark>user interface</mark> (UI) incudes all the parts of a computing system that you use to operate the computer. For example, the user interface for playing a video game on a phone includes the touch screen, speakers/headphones, and the game's on-screen menus, buttons, and graphics.</p>
        <br>
        <p>A <mark>graphical user interface</mark> (GUI, pronounced "GOO-ey," like soft brownies) is a type of user interface that uses icons and symbols on a screen instead of just plain text. A GUI makes it easy for just about anyone to use a computer. Most user interfaces are GUIs.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The <mark>command-line interface</mark> (command line, or CLI) uses only text to operate a computer. This type of interface is more difficult to se because the user must type specific commands, or phrases, for it to work. Although most computer users will never need to use a command-line interface, it's a good thing to learn if you're a computer scientist.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Human-computer interaction (HCI) is the part of computer science that studies and improves how the user works with computers. UIs are easy for all people to use, including those who are blind or low vision or are deaf or hard of hearing.</p>
