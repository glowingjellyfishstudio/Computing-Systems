        <h1>What is a Computer?</h1>
        <p>A <mark>computer</mark> stores, shares and analyzes huge amounts of data. It can also perform complex math cacluations.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Although a CD (compact disk) can store information like music, it's not concidered a computer because the CD itself can't change information</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Computers Through Time</h1>
        <p>Thousands of years ago, people made devices like the <mark>abacus</mark> to help them cacluate complex math.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the 1600s, computing became a profession and the word "computer" meant "a person who makes cacluations." Computers (the people) used a tool called the <mark>slide rule</mark> to help them cacluate.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In 1944, during the World War II, the first electronic computer was made. It was first called [COLOSSUS MARK 1] and was uded by the British goverment to crack secret German codes.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In 1945, Americans created a faster computer called [ENIAC].</p>
        <br>
        <h3>ENIAC</h3>
        <p>Stands for"<u>E</u>lectronic <u>N</u>umerical <u>I</u>ntegrator <u>a</u>nd <u>C</u>omputer," which was the first programmable, general-purpose computer.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Early computers were massive-they took up entire rooms! These computers were used by large buisnesses, goverments, or researchers./p>
        <br>
        <p>The first mass-produced personal computer, the [APPLE II], was introuced in 1977. Owners could use the computer to run simple programs or play games.</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>They run programs (like messaging, photo editing, and maps).</li>
            <li>They store information (like photos, contact information and documents).</li>
            <li>They perform cacluations (with a cacluator, with the clock/stopwatch, with maps).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Smartphones are more powerful computers than the computer used on the rocket that took the astronauts to the moon in 1969.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Part Of A whole</h1>
        <p>Computers are made up of two parts: <mark>hardware</mark> and <mark>software</mark>.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Hardware</h2>
        <p>Hardware is the physical parts of a computer, like the keyboard, mouse, and screen. An easy way to determine whether part of a computer system is hardare is to look: If you can see it with your eyes, it's hardware.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Software</h2>
        <p>Software is the set of programs (instructions) that tell a computer what to do, like phone applications, editing programs, and entertainmenr services. There aew all kinds of software: from games for a gaming system, to the program that runs on your microwave, to the web browser on your phone. Software is stored on storage devices (hardware) like hard drives, flash drives, and CDs.</p>
        <br>
        <p>An <b>application</b> (app) is a program designed for the user to perform a task-like a photo.</p>
        <br>
        <p>All applicaions are programs, but not all programs are applications. Some programs are for computer's use only-not the person using the computer.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Take A Closer Look At Hardware</h1>
        <p>Hardware can be seperated into different categories.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Input</h2>
        <p>Input refers to the parts used to send information to a computer, including a keyboard, mouse, game controller, and webcam.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Storage</h2>
        Storage refers to the parts that the computer uses to store information, including hard drives, <mark>USB flash drives</mark>, CDs, and <mark>RAM</mark>.
        <br>
        <h3>USB (universal serial bus) Flash Drive</h3>
        <p>Also known as a thumb drive or a USB stick; a portable plug-in device used to store information.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>RAM (random access memory)</h3>
        <p>A type of computer memory where information can be stored.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Processing</h2>
        <p>The processing parts of the computer run programs, interpret input, and supply output, icluding the central processing unit (CPU) and the graphics processing unit (GPU).</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h3>
        <p>This is the brain of a computer. <u>It recives input information and executes commands from other hardware and software.</u> It is made up of the main memory, the control unit, and the arithmetic logic unit.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)</h3>
        <p>This part of a computer focuses on graphics. Graphics are images of all kinds (pictures, animations, videos). <u>The GPU delivers images, animations, and videos that can be viewed on the computers screen.</u> If you want to use the best picture quality for your favourite computer game, you'll need a high-end GPU to make the graphics look good.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Think of the CPU as a jack-of-all-trades (like a handyman) and the GPU as the master of a trade (like a plumber). The CPU is great for completing a variety of everyday tasks well; the GPU specializes in processing display information quickly. You wouldn't want a handyman to replace all the pipes in your home. Instead, you'd want your plumber to use his or her special skills to perform that task.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Output</h2>
        <p>Putput refers to the parts that the computer uses to send information to you. This includes the projector, the monitor, the printer, speakers, and headphones.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The parts of hardware all work together. Data (information) comes from the user (who may be the person or a computer) and goes through the imput device into processing. Data can then be placed in storage (saved) or taken out of storage and then sent to the user.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Is a touch screen an imput or output part? It's both.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The process is like digestion: We take in food, process it and store it, and then pass it out.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>A Closer Look At Software</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>Application Software (Apps)</h2>
        <p>Application software (apps) are programs that allow the user to complete tasks.</p>
        <br>
        <p>"App" is short for "application."</p>
        <br>
        <p>Word processors, internet broswers, and games are all examples of application software. Every app in a phone's app store is also application software. There's a wide variety of application software, and programmers can specialize in one of the subcategories.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>For example:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A <b>Web Developer</b> is a programmer who makes application software that runs on websites.</li>
            <li>A <b>Mobile Developer</b> is a programmer who writes application software for mobile devices like phones and tablets.</li>
            <li>A <b>Game Developer</b> is a programmer who developes application software video games.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>System Software</h2>
        <p>System software are the programs that make sure the individual hardware devices work together and properly with other programs. <mark>Operating Systems</mark> like Windows on a laptop or iSO (the mobile operating system) on an iPhone are examples of system software (and also Android). Operating systems run in the background; you cannot see what they're doing on-screen. <u>The operating system makes it possible to install games, social media, and other apps on the phone.</u></p>
        <br>
        <p>Applications cannot work without the system software.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Operating Systems</h3>
        <p>Programs that communicate with hardware, allowing other programs to run in the background</p>
        <br>
        <p>Hardware and software are pretty much useless on their own. Only when they are put together in a complete system do they become tools.</p>
        <br>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <br>
        <p>Hardware + Software = Final Result</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cameara + Photo App = Phone To Take Selfies</li>
            <li>Keyboard And Printer + Word Processing Program = Printed Party Invitation</li>
            <li>Car And Sensors And Camearas + Street Navigation Program = Self-Driving Car</li>
        </ul>
