        <h1>What is Computer Science?</h1>
        <p>A <mark>computer</mark> is a device that stores and processes (changes, moves, or rewrites) information. It can perform complicated computations and organise and store huge amounts of information. Computer science is the study of technology can be used to solve problems. It involves studying <mark>computing systems</mark>, programming rules, data and analysis, networking, the internet, and how computers affect out lives. Computers are better than humams at storing and sharing tons of information, solving complex cacluations quickly, and learnin things. <span class="underline">Computer scientists use computers' abilities to help them to develop new technologies that make our lives easier.</span></p>
        <br>
        <h3>Computing System</h3>
        <p>All the basic hardware (the parts you can see and touch) and software (the programs) that work together to make a computer run.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Computer technology affects the way we live and think. It can help us solve our problems and make our lives seem easier, more fun, and safer.</p>
        <h2>For example</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Computers helped navigate spacecraft to the moon and Mars.</li>
            <li>Robots help surgeons perform surgeries with great precision.</li>
            <li>Computers add realistic visual sand sound effects to movies and video games.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Computer scientists use and create technology to solve problems. They program computers to both complete tasks better and faster as well as teach them how to do new things. Becoming a computer scientist means shifting from being only a <b>consumer</b> (someone who uses something) to being a <b>creator</b>.</b></p>
        <p>Computer science is a type of problem solving; it includes the study of computers, their design, and the way they process information.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Examples of what computer science IS:</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Creating a phone app (application or program) that allows friends to share funny cat videos to each other.</li>
            <li>Programming your own video game.</li>
            <li>Writing a program that cacluates the answers to the maths problems in your homework.</li>
            <li>Writing a program to automacially post nice comments on your friends' pictures.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Examples of what computer science IS NOT:</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Watching videos on the internet of cats riding tricycles.</li>
            <li>Playing your favourite video game.</li>
            <li>Doing your maths homework on your school's laptop.</li>
            <li>Commenting on the latest picture your friend posted.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All the examples in the <b>IS NOT</b> list only use technology, while the examples in the <b>IS</b> list create new technology.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Don't just play on your phone. Program it!</p>
        <br>
        <h1>The Five Conecpt Areas Of Computer Science</h1>
        <p>Computer science can be deviced into five concept areas (main parts) of study:</p>
        <br>
        <h2>1. Computing Systems</h2>
        <p>Computing systems are the machines that run programs and process information. Examples are desktop computers, laptops, and phones. Many electronic devices are run by <mark>programs</mark> and have small built-in computers. For example, dishwashers, TVs, smart watches, and even some light bulbs.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Program</h3>
        <p>A set of instructions (or an algorithm) that has been translated into commands a computer can understand. (<b>code</b>)</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Algorithms and Programming</h2>
        <p><mark>Algorithms</mark> and programming involve writing the programs (code) that tell computers what to do. Programs can be very complex-like iTunes, Safari, Chrone, or Roblox-following many different instructions. They can also be simple, like a program that only prints out the message "Hello, World!"</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Algorithm</h3>
        <p>A list of steps or instructions written in human language that tells a person how to complete a task.</p>
        <br>
        Writing a program is sometimes broken up into two steps:
        <br>
        <p><b>Step 1:</b> The computer scientist makes a list of step-by-step instructions for what she/he wants her/his program to do.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Step 2:</b> The computer scientist translates her/his instructions into a language (code) the computer can understand. Now the algorithm is a program.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Computers are very powerful, but they are really aren't that smart. They can only do what they're told. Programs give computers the instructions they need to work.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>3. Data and Analysis</h2>
        <p><mark>Data</mark> and <mark>analysis</mark> refer to collecting, storing, organizing, and studying facts to help us understand what the data means. For example, in a personality test program, we would want to collect answers to the questions (such as: "So you like having lost of friends over to play games?" or "How do you like to spend your free time?"), store the answers, and study them to understand someone's personality. Another simple use of data might be to collect and store the score in a video game so that we can see if a player has won, or who the highest scorer was.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Computers are great at storing, sharing, and cacluating huge amounts of data. This mkes them perfect for analysing data.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Data</h3>
        <p>raw, unorganized facts</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p>organizing, discribing, and unserstanding data</p>
        <br>
        <h2>4. Networks and the Internet</h2>
        <p><mark>Networks</mark> are a group of connected devices (like computers, laptops, and servers). They share information, and may also share resorces like a printer. The <mark>internet</mark> is the worldwide network that connects millions of computers. Part of studying networks and the internet is figuring out better and more serure ways to share information across devices.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>5. Impacts of Computing</h2>
        <p>Understanding the impacts of computing involve studying how computers influence our lives, cultire, safety, laws, and behaviour. Just because we can make new technologies doesn't mean we should.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Think about a bad thing that you can do with a program.</p>
        <br>
        <b>Questions to consider:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>What would the effect be on the victims' lives?</li>
            <li>How would your actions affect your friendships?</li>
            <li>Are there laws against using such programs?</li>
            <li>Would it be wrong to share a program like that even if we didn't use it ourselves?</li>
            <li>Would this new technology make life better or worse for others?</li>
        </ul>
